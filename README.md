# Business Problem
“In a world buzzing with live streams, there's a silent barrier that separates millions from experiencing the full spectrum of content: the deaf community. But what if we could turn that silence into a symphony of inclusion and empowerment?” 

# Introduction
The BeAware project is tailored to assist individuals with hearing challenges. Our focus is on establishing a robust foundation that includes secure sign-up and sign-in processes, as well as essential functions for process and database management to ensure secure data storage. Users play a pivotal role by providing three essential inputs: a color code, a stream name, and a logo. These inputs are employed in an API call to generate a secure stream URL. The resulting URL is then shared with users as a QR code, along with a detailed instructional guide.
